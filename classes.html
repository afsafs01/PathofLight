        Although designed for intermediate to advanced students, beginners are
        welcome to sample this 60 minute class that focuses on breath-synchronized

    <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
    <p>
        Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms
        at your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply.
        Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll
        on to your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position
        with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful
        for all that you have in life. Namaste.
